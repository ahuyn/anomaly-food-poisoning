		<text>Activated charcoal tablets</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_carbon_descr">
		<text>Consumable activated charcoal tablets produced from coconut husks that are used to treat ingested poisons and toxins. The tablet works by mechanically trapping potential toxic chemicals or poisons in micropores, preventing poisons from being procesed by the body but also trapping any undigested vitamins, drugs, or alcohol. Very commonly used by stalkers to counteract the toxins that are common in mutant flesh and old food.\n \n

		<text>Emetine vial</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_emetic_descr">
		<text>Vial of emetine, a drug derived from the ipecac root. Emetine is often used to treat amoeba dysentery and to induce vomiting in poisoning situations. Being a mild poison itself, it is unsafe to take this drug in unapproved doses. This is considered by many stalkers as a last resort if they ate something foul or dangerous and need it ejected out of their system, like a really bad meal. To use, go to a far-away corner, take the dropper out and put three drops in the back of your throat.\n \n

		<text>Blind Dog Distillate</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_decoction_dog_descr">
		<text>Foul-smelling purple liquid made from the hearts and livers of blind dogs. Affectionately known by stalkers as 'Hair of the Dog', this is a favorite folk remedy for fatigue and tiredness. It also confers some of the Blind Dog's natural resistance to toxicity, however the drink is mildly toxic itself. The taste isn't too terrible, either - if you imagine you're drinking a glass of kvass it almost tastes the same.\n \n

		<text>Rank purple liquid that burns the nose hairs on smelling. This disgusting concoction is made from the raw meat and eyes of mutated pigs. Accelerates the body's healing mechanisms by unknown means, and thus the best thing for a wounded stalker recovering from his injuries. However, the taste makes you wish for a bullet.\n \n

Causes the body to rapidly produce red blood cells and platelets and hastens natural wound regeneration, making it extremely potent at dealing with bleeding and open wounds. In demand amongst Duty members to seal up wounds incurred when clearing mutant nests. The taste is not too bad either, but the texture of the medicine makes it hard to swallow. \n \n

A potent alternative to the more popular 'Hair of the Dog', this drink is used by experienced hunters to chase their prey for long distances and stay mentally alert even after days in the field. However, catching cats is more difficult than dogs, and oftentimes Lurkers will make meals out of hapless stalkers, so this is a relatively uncommon concoction.\n \n

		<text>Murky, bitter medicine made from the heart and flesh of the mighty Chimera. Stored in a flask as direct exposure to light denatures the active ingredients. Chimera blood have high amounts of unknown organic molecules that superficially resemble steroids, which scientists believe grant the monster its stupendous power, stamina, and regenerative ability. This medicine allows stalkers to have a small fraction of the Chimera's ability, but due to the difficulty of sourcing ingredients it is extremely rare. The medicine is also highly toxic to the blood, so extended use is not recommended.\n \n
