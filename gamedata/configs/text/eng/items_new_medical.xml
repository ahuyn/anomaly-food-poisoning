	</string>
	<string id="st_carbon_descr">
		<text>Consumable activated charcoal tablets produced from coconut husks that are used to treat ingested poisons and toxins. The tablet works by mechanically trapping potential toxic chemicals or poisons in micropores, preventing poisons from being procesed by the body but also trapping any undigested vitamins, drugs, or alcohol. Very commonly used by stalkers to counteract the toxins that are common in mutant flesh and old food.\n \n

		<text>Emetine vial</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_emetic_descr">
		<text>Vial of emetine, a drug derived from the ipecac root. Emetine is often used to treat amoeba dysentery and to induce vomiting in poisoning situations. Being a mild poison itself, it is unsafe to take this drug in unapproved doses. This is considered by many stalkers as a last resort if they ate something foul or dangerous and need it ejected out of their system, like a really bad meal. To use, go to a far-away corner, take the dropper out and put three drops in the back of your throat.\n \n
